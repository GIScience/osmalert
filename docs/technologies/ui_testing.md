"The Selenium framework ties all of these pieces together through a user-facing interface that enables the different browser backends to be used transparently, enabling cross-browser and cross-platform automation."

 + Opensource and free
 + W3C Recommendation
 + Good documentation, large community, large library of plugins/extensions
 + Supports Java
 + Drives a browser natively (either locally or on a remote machine)
 + Supports: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari
 - (-)  Setup costs: creating a stable and maintenable test framework need time (e.g: one need to download a driver for each  browser.
 - (-) no built-in visual regression testing
 - (-) no built-in reporting support (e.g.,external solutions needed to record videos)
