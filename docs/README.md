Tools and Services by HeiGIT:
* [ohsome API](https://docs.ohsome.org/ohsome-api/v1/): The ohsome API is a generic web API for in-depth analysis of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data with a focus on its history. It allows to get aggregated statistics about the evolution of OSM data itself and about the contributors behind the data. Furthermore, data extraction methods are provided to access the historic development of individual OSM features.
* [ohsome Dashboard](https://dashboard.ohsome.org/): The ohsome Dashboard generates accurate statistics about the historical development of OSM data for custom or predefined regions all over the world.
* [ohsomeNow stats dashboard](https://stats.now.ohsome.org): offers up-to-date and global scale overview statistics on mapping activity in OpenStreetMap (OSM). 

Other Tools and Resources:
* [OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page): The OpenStreetMap Wiki is a place for help documentation, technical documentation and promotional material on everything related to the OpenStreetMap project. It is not the OpenStreetMap project itself, but rather a documentation store designed to provide guidance for map contributors and users.
* [taginfo](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/): Taginfo helps you by showing statistics about which tags are actually in the OSM database, how many people use those tags, where they are used and so on. It also gets information about tags from the wiki and from other places.
* [OSM Changesets of the last 30 Days](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-changesets?comment=MissingMaps#2/12.6/6.0): search for specific terms that have been used in a changesetâ€™s comment section within the past 30 days. The changesets are based on an hourly updated OSM database.
* [OSM in realtime](https://jwestman.gitlab.io/osm-in-realtime/): OSM In Realtime downloads the minutely changeset feed provided by OpenStreetMap and shows the changesets on the map. It isn't really intended for any useful mapping purpose. The developer just thought it would be a cool visualization. (And it is!)
* [OSM Notes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes): Notes are not directly related to the OSM data, but more to the [OSM website](https://openstreetmap.org/). It enables everyone to add a comment on the map to assist others in mapping/editing OpenStreetMap. Other users can respond to your notes, for example to ask for additional details if necessary.
